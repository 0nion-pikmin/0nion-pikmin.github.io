          Surprisingly, what gave me trouble the most wasn't coding the copyright or ampersand symbol. What caused me so much trouble was getting the CSS formatting to display properly in the XML file, and trying to make "List of Books"' formatting correct without affecting the formatting of what inside the table <br>

          I had a lot of trouble with formating Account_Total to fit the requirements. Being so used to if/else in programming class, I was so sure xsl:if was the right answer and spent hours trying to make it work. I was wrong. xsl:choose was a much better choice. <br>

          Surprisingly, I struggled the most with the schema for "Name" instead of "Phone". I thought maxLength could be put inside xs:element for name; it couldn't. maxLength has to has "value" after that, and has to be inside "simpleType" and "restriction". The rules are quite strict<br>
          I knew a little bit of regex from my Linux scripting class so figuring out the schema for Phone wasn't hard<br>

          <b style="color: red">Comment:</b> 
          I made many small mistakes in this assignment. For example, it should have been "xmlns:east" instead of "east:xmlns" before the http link. Probably the biggest shock (to me) that just simply putting a comment at the very top of the xml file causes error. I was so shocked. This has never happened to me while coding in C++ or Java, so I was sure I did something wrong in the body instead of the header<br>
          Also, after combining the 2 xml files, I was careless & didn't put "</states>" at the very end of the final xml file. Took me a while to fix that error.
          Christopher Cardoso's provided XML video was a lifesaver. I was so happy when my xml file finally passed the validator check<br>

          It's my first time displaying raw code in html. It's fun! I couldn't display raw XML data on HTML, though. I tried many tags like pre, code, codeblock, and a few combinations of those 3 tags but I still couldn't do it. So I used hyperlink instead. I wonder how tutorial sites like w3schools does it<br>
          Another trouble that I ran into is my custom h3.thick (a custom class of h3) tag in my css file doesn't work at all. I had to use inline style instead to display the changes that I want<br>
