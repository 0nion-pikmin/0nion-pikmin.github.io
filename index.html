          Surprisingly, what gave me trouble the most wasn't coding the copyright or ampersand symbol. What caused me so much trouble was getting the CSS formatting to display properly in the XML file, and trying to make "List of Books"' formatting correct without affecting the formatting of what inside the table <br>

          I had a lot of trouble with formating Account_Total to fit the requirements. Being so used to if/else in programming class, I was so sure xsl:if was the right answer and spent hours trying to make it work. I was wrong. xsl:choose was a much better choice. <br>

          Your XPath doc, honestly all of your doc so far, was really helpful. I'll use them for my new job. And thanks for the detailed comments for my previous assignments, Professor! My knowledge on this is really rusty so I really appreciate your feedback&#129505; <br>

          Surprisingly, I struggled the most with the schema for "Name" instead of "Phone". I thought maxLength could be put inside xs:element for name; it couldn't. maxLength has to has "value" after that, and has to be inside "simpleType" and "restriction". The rules are quite strict<br>
          I knew a little bit of regex from my Linux scripting class so figuring out the schema for Phone wasn't hard<br>

          <b style="color: red">Comment:</b> 
          I made many small mistakes in this assignment. For example, it should have been "xmlns:east" instead of "east:xmlns" before the http link.<br>
          Also, after combining the 2 xml files, I was careless & didn't put "</states>" at the very end of the final xml file. Took me a while to fix that error.
          Christopher Cardoso's provided XML video was a lifesaver. I was so happy when my xml file finally passed the validator check<br>
