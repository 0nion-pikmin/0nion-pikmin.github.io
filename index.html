          Surprisingly, what gave me trouble the most wasn't coding the copyright or ampersand symbol. What caused me so much trouble was getting the CSS formatting to display properly in the XML file, and trying to make "List of Books"' formatting correct without affecting the formatting of what inside the table <br>

          I had a lot of trouble with formating Account_Total to fit the requirements. Being so used to if/else in programming class, I was so sure xsl:if was the right answer and spent hours trying to make it work. I was wrong. xsl:choose was a much better choice. <br>
